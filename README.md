# Abstract

This application is designed as an eBay-like e-commerce auction site which allows signed users to _post_
auction listings, _place_ bids on listings, _comment_ on those listings, and _add_ listings to a **watchlist**. Users who created a given listing have the ability to _close_ the auction from this page, which makes the highest bidder (if any) the winner of the auction. This app is implemented with _HTML_, _CSS_, _JavasScript_, _Bootstrap_, _Python_, _Django_ and the _SQLite_ database. It can be seen live [here](https://clone-ebay.herokuapp.com/).
