# Abstract

This application is implemented as clone-like _Ebay_ using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and Django. It supports _registering_ and _logging_ in of users, as well _creation_ of new listings , whith corresponding titles, description, categories and images.  Users can _place bids_ on listed items, _add comments_ to it, and also
creating a _whatchlist_ for those products which are of special interest. Users who created a given listing have the ability to _close_ the auction from this page, which makes the highest bidder (if any) the winner of the auction, thus making the listing no longer active.
